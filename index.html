            <p class="text-center">The first God of War had a very "open" interface, with information spread across the screen. Santa Monica Studios created this open feel with the heavy usage of icons, which meant users would have to play the game a bit to eventually get used to the icons and what they represented. While there may have been some navigational issues in the beginning of the game, players quickly understood with in-game tutorials helping the user. Rarity colors of items were extremely clear, the navigational bar at the top made it clear which category you were in, stats were understandable.</p>

            <p class="text-center">As for the Shop, the first Norse God of War game was fairly simplistic, with categories defined with icons. There were categories strictly for crafting, upgrading, buying, and selling owned items.

            <p class="text-center">Moving on to the sequel, one can immediately see that they went for a cleaner, darker look. All information was moved to the left side of the screen, rather than spread across like the first game. The game's menus are crowded with information and symbols with loot, gear, and abilities being spread out across multiple tabs and screens. It takes far more user navigation and interactibility to be able to find looted items and see what is equipped. </p>

            <p class="text-center">An issue I ran into with the shop interface in Ragnarok was the uncategorization of crafting, upgrading, and already owned items. Being that they were all put together, someone with visibility issues such as myself would have the issue of accidentally upgrading items I did not have equipped. Frustrated with these accidents, I would sell these items only for them to still display as repurchaseable in the same section so there was no getting rid of it.

                  <p class="portfolio-projects--desc">For example, used in Horizon Zero Dawn, instead of forcing a character display on right side, Ragnarok could focus its attention on what is actually wanting to be seen, the inventory. Sorting the items by rarity colors, providing an image of what item is being displayed would make things far more convenient for the visibility of the user. Not only that, but by hovering the icons, the user could potentially see what attachments are equipped, the stats of the item and more by providing a "legend" display to the right rather than Kratos (even though he is handsome). </p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-projects--title">Shop System</h4>
                  <p class="portfolio-projects--desc">The shop can also be far more simplified in terms of navigationability. As seen again in Horizon Zero Dawn, they reuse the icons used in inventory to deliver the same experience for the user. By creating consistency, users can adapt far quicker to a game's UI. Creating seperate categorization for different functions (crafting, buying, selling) is a must to reduce accidents. God of War wastes a lot of space trying to show off the characters unneccesarily when they could be displaying more information for the items that are being looked at. If the user wishes to see what an armor looks like on their character, it can be bound to a control that will display the armor on their character in a different screen.</p>
